# Cooling Load Calculation Tool

This project aims to estimate the cooling load of residential buildings according to the ASHRAE2021.

There are lots of commercial software to do it, but most need to simulate the buildings or use input as files with special formats.
"Cooling Load Estimator" uses some simple input by the user without any 2D or 3D simulation or preparing input files. This simple app could be used for a fast estimation of heating load, especially for renovation and retrofitting of buildings, when you need to estimate heating load without 3D simulation.
In addition, this app is operational in the estimation of the effect of fenestration sizes, types, insulation layers, light numbers, appliances, and the number of people who use the building  in decreasing or increasing the heating load at the same time.

NOTE: THIS CALCULATION IS REGARDLESS OF THE "SHADING DEVICES" IMPACT.

# Installation
You can readily run the main.py file with a Python compiler. If you need the main.exe file please send an Email malihehjahanbakhsh.eng@gmail.com
